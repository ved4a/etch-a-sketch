# etch-a-sketch

Hello! This is an online Etch-a-Sketch, a popular handheld game for children. I made this entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and decided on the color palette by searching up "retro color palette design". Whoever ends up finding this repo, I hope you have fun playing with it!
